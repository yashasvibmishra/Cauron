This is a telegram bot that ensures whether proper social distancing is being practised or not by street pedestrians. We are performing object detection on a live feed of various CCTV cameras (for convenience these are fed as video recorded inputs, however, the feed stream can be live as well). Primarily YOLOv3, OpenCV, and Telegram's bot API have been used to develop this bot. 

After the bot runs for a fixed period, which is totally upon the user to run it for as much time as they deem fit. One shall keep receiving the number of violations that have occurred on the street during this time duration. These violations shall be reported through pings and notifications.
